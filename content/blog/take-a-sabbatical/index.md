    In life, we are left to live in the mononteny of everyday life. We wake up, make breakfast, possibly eat it in front of
    our coworkers at stand-up, work until dinner and then are so brain-dead from work, that you spend the next hours of your 
    life in front of a tv, trapped in mindless noise. 

##### Disclaimer

    How are we supposed to unlock our connection to others and the world when we
    are in fact sold that our entire existance should be for work. 

    Now, I do understand that some people are financally not in a place for this advice. 
    I have no thoughts here, other than that there are so many opportunies to break into tech,
    and to me tech is one of the only opportunies that I have seen to get in a better 
    financial place.
